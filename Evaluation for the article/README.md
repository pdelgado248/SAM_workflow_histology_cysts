The "Compute test scores.ipynb" file includes the code needed for the resulting masks on specific patches from the SAM workflow and the automatic version of Cystanalyser to be compared to the ground truth. 

In the "Histology cuts data.ipynb" file, several masks of the full kidney cuts are processed to obtain cystic area measures and other related data. To apply it to different images, the paths would need to be modified, as well as the numerical IDs of each cut, that in our experiment corresponded to different time steps.
